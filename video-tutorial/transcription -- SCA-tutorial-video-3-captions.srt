Hi everyone! Welcome to this third video tutorial regarding the 
Shared Contacts Admin tool or SCA which is an open-source, web-based solution that allows
you to manage your shared contacts from Google apps. In the previous two videos

2
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:24,689
we were able to show the working demo of the SCA. 
and the next video, we're able to download and install the SCA in an app engine.

3
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:35,790
And now, what we're going to show you is How to setup the 
Google developer console in order to

4
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:44,930
enable the APIs and the authentication. But before we proceed
let me just show you the snippet of the code that we have for the SCA

5
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:56,520
And that because it's related to the one that we're going to configure in the developer console.
As you can see in this file,the oauth.go file, you will see here

6
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:16,189
the configuration the we need to fill up. Once you were able to configure the
APIs in the developer console. So basically you are going to need the Client ID and the Client Secret
So that before we re-install the SCA you are going to modify this file. Also I want to show you

7
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:19,680
that there will be a lot of Redirects that we need to

8
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:38,670
put in the configuration in the developer console. So these are required because
open Authentication requires us to indicate what are the valid domain and the redirect
URLs that we'll be able to cover. So let us

9
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:47,140
proceed to the developer console in order to enable
the contact's API to setup the authentication and the redirect URL

10
00:01:49,190 --> 00:02:23,030
so in the Google Developer console, go to API
and then, click on contact's API. And then we're going to enable that.
And now that's enabled, we need to go to credentials.

11
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,730
We're going to setup

12
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:32,250
open authentication "oauth" client ID. And this is for

13
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:37,520
a web operation. But before that we need to configure the

14
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:48,570
consent screen, that is basically the page
that user sees when it is being prompted in the open authentication. 
So basically let's try to

15
00:02:48,570 --> 00:03:44,010
name that Shared Contacts Admin. Let's leave the optional parameters as these.
Since I was not able to configure the consent screen. So basically this is where
the Shared Contacts Admin.

16
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,260
These are optional parameters. We're going to save it

17
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:27,169
We're going to create a Web Application Client ID. Let's create
oauth.go. And in here we're going to setup the redirect URLs. So

18
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:30,169
just copy the one that we have on our list.

19
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:29,769
So now we have the Client ID and the Client Secret. 
So in your case you have to

20
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:40,009
take note of this and this is the one that we're going to input
in the oauth.go file before we install the SCA again. We don't need to

21
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:52,689
download the JSON.
So the next thing we need to do is to input the Client ID and the Secret key and the

22
00:05:52,689 --> 00:06:03,969
oauth file. So let's go to... I'll just use this command to direct.

23
00:06:41,180 --> 00:07:47,639
I'll just get the Client ID. And then I'm going to replace the Client Secret
And then I'm going to save it. And let's go back to credentials again. We need to
create an API key for the browser

24
00:07:47,639 --> 00:08:02,310
We're going to check the Slide tutorial that I have created a while ago
so that we don't mix our find. So basically this slide shows us the step by step process.

25
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:09,659
So now we have enabled the contacts API. And we're going to create a server key.

26
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:58,550
And then next, we're going to setup now the Google apps. 
Hopefully we're done with the developer console. Now we're going to 
go to the Google Apps in order to enable the contacts sharing

27
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:54,590
Okay so, I think I'm just going to record a new video on how to 
configure the Google apps because I'm reaching the limit now of this video.
So thank you for

28
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:57,090
watching this video. Watch out for the next on configuring Google Apps
