Hi Everyone!

2
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:23,939
Welcome to this first video tutorial regarding the Shared Contacts Admin
It is an Open Source Web-Based Application that runs on Google App Engine

3
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,550
And it allows you to maintain your shared contacts on your Google Apps.

4
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:43,780
So basically this part 1 Video Tutorial is going to show you
the working demo on how to use the SCA to import,export and delete contacts.

5
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:49,960
So basically, we're going to look first on the existing contacts that we have.

6
00:00:51,170 --> 00:01:02,620
So basically as you can see here, this is an admin account for a Google Apps for work
and it has existing contacts in here. So what we're going to do is

7
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:11,120
to use the SCA tool to delete these contacts

8
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:20,920
Basically, the working demo of the Shared Contacts Admin tool 
has sections like import, delete and export.

9
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:24,729
So what we're going to do is to try first this "Delete Contacts" so that we can

10
00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:33,590
refresh the contacts directory. 
So if you press the delete contacts button, you're going to import the domain name

11
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:44,240
and click "delete contacts".
So basically here the results show that we have deleted 16 contacts. 

12
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:13,520
So let us refresh this directory.

13
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:26,900
So as you can see here the contacts have been deleted. 
Now we're going to test how to import the contacts using a csv file
going to your contacts and in your tray using 

14
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,900
the Shared Contacts Admin tool.

15
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:50,380
So what we're going to do is to import the contacts.
Now, I want to show you an example of a csv file that would contain that. 
So this is a sample csv file that contains the contacts

16
00:02:50,380 --> 00:03:00,180
that you want to update into your Google App
So this is very useful if you have hundreds of contacts

17
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,600
and you want to automatically put them to your Google Apps Directory

18
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:08,980
without doing it manually.
So using the SCA tool, We're going to click 

19
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:26,180
import contacts point it to the directory while you have
the sample csv format. 

20
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:36,640
Actually there is a sample csv that comes with the SCA tool.
So right here we're going to select this file and then put there

21
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,640
the domain. And Click import

22
00:03:49,040 --> 00:04:29,699
So now the import has been successful so to verify that
We're going to check back the contacts directory.
As you can see the contacts have been uploaded	

23
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:39,470
to the contacts directory which is very useful if you are going to share
hundred of contacts to everyone, 

24
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:43,370
to all users in your domain
So right now the

25
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:51,830
Delete contacts and the import contacts are now working.
What we're going to try to do next is to try to export the

26
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:59,570
contacts from Google Apps, going to a csv file or an xml file.
So what we're going to do is 

27
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:00,409
we're going to

28
00:05:00,409 --> 00:05:12,849
export the contacts into a csv file. 
Just click export, put there the domain name. And then click "Export CSV" 

29
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:23,569
What will happen is it's going to create here a csv file
That's downloaded in your local directory

30
00:05:23,569 --> 00:05:39,509
If you're going to open that in Excel
it's going to show let's say a format that you have in Excel.
Or if you want to open it in your text file, it shows us a csv formatted file

31
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:47,520
containing the contacts that has been exported from your Google Apps.
So there we go 

32
00:05:47,520 --> 00:06:02,860
We were able to demonstrate that the Shared Contacts Admin, SCA Tool has been able to
successfully import, export and delete contacts.

33
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:16,779
So if you want to check out this is the github repository and
this is the demo that we were able to try out a while ago.
So watch out for the  other video tutorials

34
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:28,399
regarding the other portions like How to Install it in App engine, 
how to setup the authentication system and so on.

35
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:28,810
So thank you very much for watching this video.
