Hi Everyone! Welcome to the second video tutorial regarding the Shared Contacts Admin. 
In the second video, we are going to show you how you will install SCA

2
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:31,949
on the App Engine.This will not cover the setup of the API and the Google Apps
Coz' we're going to cover that on our next video. 
So the first step is we're going to get the repository from Github. Here's the URL for the repository.

3
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,949
And we're going to use the Github Shell and you can also use the command prompt.

4
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:28,340
So I'm going to create a new folder for a demo. And I'm going to download here the...

5
00:01:28,340 --> 00:02:43,420
So while waiting for the files to be downloaded, we're going to go to the developer console
and we're going to create a new app engine ID... and then I'm going to set up the permission.

6
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:19,549
Okay, so my username cannot be used to install two app engine.I'm using another admin account.
This time it's going to deligate in this e-mail address to be able to install an application

7
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:53,409
to this app engine. And I'm just going to check the... email and now I'm going to approve the indication
to be able to become an admin. In your case you may not need to

8
00:03:53,409 --> 00:04:07,419
do this if you are able to install or use your email address to install the Google App engine.
I think, in my case, I'm not able to use the other email address

9
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:11,310
because that one was secured.

10
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:24,479
Lead you to the two step now of the authentication process. So let's wait for the indication.
Should be accepted

11
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:34,689
accept invitation.

12
00:04:34,689 --> 00:05:01,099
So now that the invitation has been accepted, let's just close this window. 
Now that the invitation has been accepted, let's try to install now the SCA

13
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:25,589
to the app engine admin I created. So we have created G-apps-sca-0006
and then we're going to use the other admin account

14
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:55,270
This, I'm going to clear the Vendor folder because a while ago I've got an error on that
And I'm also going to clear the tutorial because I also got an error next to that but not critical. 
Partly I was able to close my gitbash. So let us open now the gitbash app.

15
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:06,889
If you don't have a gitbash, you can use your command prompt.

16
00:06:52,689 --> 00:07:01,559
So now the application is being deployed to the project ID 
that we have just created a while ago. So it has been completed successfully

17
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:06,069
And right now what we're going to do is to try to access it.

18
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:22,399
So basically our new project ID is this one and we can try to access the
web-based interface of the SCA. So there you go, you have now

19
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,249
installed the

20
00:07:23,249 --> 00:07:37,309
web-based interface of the SCA it has a function to import contacts, to export contacts
and then to delete contacts. And that's all we have to do in this video tutorial.

21
00:07:37,309 --> 00:07:47,089
We're going to cover the next part which allows us
to configure the Google Developer Console in

22
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:53,919
order to set up the APIs said and the credentials
especially the open authentication and then we're going to

23
00:07:53,919 --> 00:08:10,110
the redirect URLs and more on signing up the security
and be able to communicate with the Google APIs. Okay, so this project ID and this is just the UI

24
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:18,800
for the SCA. We need to setup the credentials
in order for this SCA application to be able to communicate with

25
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,409
Google Apps and the Google API so thank you for
watching this video.
