Hi Everyone! Welcome to this 4th video tutorial regarding the Shared Contacts Admin.
This is an open-source, web-based application that allows us to manage our contacts
especially our shared contacts from Google Apps

2
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:26,930
So the goal of this video is for us to be able
to setup Google apps for work or education

3
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:42,980
And we're going to enable contacts sharing and 
we're going back to the developer console in order to manage other configurations
like the service account

4
00:00:42,980 --> 00:01:16,830
So first let's go to Google Apps for work. And I'm going to show you here
how to enable the Contacts Sharing. So I have here an admin account. And I'm going to
Google Apps enable section, and then I'm going to go the contacts and on the sharing settings.

5
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,830
I need to make sure that 

6
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:37,570
the contacts sharing is enabled and show all e-mail addresses
and then show both domain profiles and all my shared contacts

7
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:42,310
and domain in public data. So this will be published in our external directory.

8
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,990
So now that's done

9
00:01:49,990 --> 00:02:06,080
we're going to

10
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:15,410
the developer console in order to setup the service account
so create credentials for a service account

11
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:46,500
and this will be for the app engine and default service account.
And then click on manage service account

12
00:02:53,090 --> 00:03:07,500
And then on the app engine default service account, edit that.
And then we're going to click on enable Google Apps domain white callibration

13
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:29,489
Let's go to the API manager home, and then the credentials

14
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:40,980
you will notice here that the when we enable the domain white callibration
the system automatically 

15
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,020
added this client for G-apps' SCA 006


16
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:56,460
So that's it, we are done with configuring the Google Apps
I think what we can do next is now we're going to re-install the

17
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,460
SCA application. 

18
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:39,129
Let's review that directory... I'd like to execute that

19
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:05,150
So now the SCA application is being uploaded
Let's go to the app engine. Basically we are doing this

20
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:15,250
because a while ago we set up the oauth.go
where we enter the client ID and the Client Secret for our application

21
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:31,210
So now that's completed, we're going 
to visit now the website

22
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:46,229
the URL for our SCA is this one
So still, we are able to see the web-UI. I think what we can do right

23
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:54,410
here is to be able to execute a function
like the import function

24
00:05:54,410 --> 00:06:05,960
So let's try to execute this one on the test data folder
we can use the sample one. If all our configurations were correct

25
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,960
we should be able to execute the import function

26
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:23,360
Okay so now it's being prompted. We need to enter the accounts we used. 
And initially you will be prompted

27
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:34,210
with this open authentication, which warns you about the permission
needed by the project ID that we have created. So just allow it

28
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:45,240
So perfect! We were able to import the records to the Google Apps
Now what we're going to do is to 

29
00:06:45,240 --> 00:07:08,800
use the other functions like, we're going to export contacts to CSV
Okay so we were able to export the contacts

30
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:21,650
So you saw the downloaded CSV file. Now let's try
Delete contacts. Before that, let's try to

31
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:47,630
visit the contacts directory, in order to validate that we were
able to import the contacts successfully. So I'm going to use my 
admin account for the Google Apps

32
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:11,940
And on the directory, I am able to see tha contacts that we 
have there. So on the next step that we're going to do, we're going to

33
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:27,460
execute a delete, all those contacts should be deleted.
okay so it says here

34
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:47,470
records were deleted. So let me just confirm that.
We're reloading this view in the contacts directory

35
00:08:47,470 --> 00:09:00,500
So there you go, all the external contents have been deleted
by our Shared Contacts Admin tool. So there you go, we have been able to 

36
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:07,110
successfully configure and install our Shared Contacts Admin tool.
So for everyone who are interested 

37
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:15,880
